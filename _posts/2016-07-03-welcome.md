This is the first post on the acclaimed artificially created platform, the Grid. It is intended to feature a collection of my photography works and an update of interesting goings-on.

I begin this site with this shot of metro station at sunset in Copenhagen, Denmark. The work is featured in an exhibition titled "Hold Me Dear: Four Cities, \[Extra\]Ordinary Places," curated by HERE+NOW, at Canonmills, Edinburgh from September 24 - October 23, 2015\.

I hope you enjoy this space as much as I do.
